# Create-Business-Idea-using-Open-Data
Leveraged multiple New Yorkâ€™s public datasets (NYC Taxi, Airbnb, Wi-Fi, etc.) to create a business proposition using R and Tableau. 

Business idea:
Created a prototype on mobile app aimed to make traveling easy for tourists
- Prototype link: https://marvelapp.com/32hcg3d
- Provide airbnb accomodation booking
- Provide taxi booking based on flight itinerary
- Provide location-based recommendation based on time (Eg. attractions, cafes, bars)
- Provide lockers for tourist to place their luggages 
- Provide powerbanks for tourist since battery is a concern during traveling
